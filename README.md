#bplist-dissector

Wireshark dissector for Safari Remote Debugging Protocol

*This is a work in progress*

Currently uses print so will only show packets in tshark

##TODO

- Implement Sets, UTF16
- Format dates correctly
- Can tree be defaulted open?
~~- Display in Wireshark rather then relying on print!~~
